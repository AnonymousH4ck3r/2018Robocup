# started
I made some modifications to my code
Remeber to use the word "Git" Ex:

```shell
git add -A
git commit -m "something name"
git push origin master
```
ALSO mAKE A CODE EVERY DAY!
Learned how to use pycharm(education)(I have to code on it every day!)

```python
number = 9
print(type(number))   # print type of variable "number"

float_number = 9.0
print(type(float_number))

r="3r"
print (type(r))

raymondissmart=True
print (type(raymondissmart))

maxisdumb=False
print (type(maxisdumb))
```
Still no orders...

 New things:
 
 .EV3 is better because it has more functions and variebles (Ev3-G is for profesionals!)
 .Ev3 basic is MicroSoft small basic combined with Ev3 basic extention
 .Microsoft is a little harder!
 .You have to have Windows 8 or you will have to chose Windows 8 even if you don't have it (It's for MicroSoft!)
