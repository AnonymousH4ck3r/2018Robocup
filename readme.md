# started
I made some modifications to my code
Remeber to use the word "Git" Ex:

```shell
git add -A
git commit -m "something name"
git push origin master
```
ALSO mAKE A CODE EVERY DAY!
Learned how to use pycharm(education)(I have to code on it every day!)

```python
number = 9
print(type(number))   # print type of variable "number"

float_number = 9.0
print(type(float_number))

r="3r"
print (type(r))

raymondissmart=True
print (type(raymondissmart))

maxisdumb=False
print (type(maxisdumb))
```
Still no orders...

 Information:
* The robot needs at least two powered wheels
 .To make the robot turn, the motors have to spin at different speeds
 .When the EV3 logo is red, it means that the robot is on and you can download your code ( P.S You have two options! Download and play or play! )

 New things:
 
 * EV3 is better because it has more functions and variebles (Ev3-G is for profesionals!)
 * Ev3 basic is MicroSoft small basic combined with Ev3 basic extention
 * Microsoft is a little harder!
 * You have to have Windows 8 or you will have to chose Windows 8 even if you don't have it (It's for MicroSoft!)
 
 # Date: 10/04/2018
 
 New things:
 
 * If you use the block "If" you will have to select a variable (To follow the line use Port and type 45!)
 * You don't want your wheels spinning too fast!
 * Use the light sensor and the ultrasonic sensor to sense where you are going!
 * Ultrasonic sensor is for basicly seeing!
 * I learnt how to make the robot follow the line!
 
 # MicroSoft small basic
 
 * I learnt that you want your speed below 50!
 * Use Motor.Move to make your robot move
 * Ex: Motor.Move("BC",-50,630,"True") this will make it go forwards for 2s and then hit the brakes
 * Use Motot.MoveSnyc to change the speed of each motor
 
 # New blocks:
 
 * Move.Motor
 * Motor.Start
 * Motor.Sync
 * Motor.StartSync
 * Motor.Stop
 * Program.Delay
 * Sensor.SetMode
 
 # Date: 11/04/2018
 
 New blocks:
 
 * Speaker.Tone
 * Speaker.Wait
 * Speaker.Note
 * Speaker.Stop
 * Speaker.Play
 * Button.Wait
 (P.S This is only for the Microsoft Small Basic!)
Do NOT NEED To use Ev3 Explorer!
