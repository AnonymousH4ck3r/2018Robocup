started
I made some modifications to my code
Remeber to use the word "Git" Ex:

```shell
git add -A
git commit -m "something name"
git push origin master
```
ALSO mAKE A CODE EVERY DAY!
Learned how to use pycharm(education)(I have to code on it every day!)

```python
number = 9
print(type(number))   # print type of variable "number"

float_number = 9.0
print(type(float_number))

r="3r"
print (type(r))

raymondissmart=True
print (type(raymondissmart))

maxisdumb=False
print (type(maxisdumb))
```
